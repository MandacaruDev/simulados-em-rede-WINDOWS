It is extremely flexible and very useful for people with some knowledge of web design and web development.</p><p>I propose other solution for docking of blocks.</p><p>The archaius settings page has multiple options that allow you to customize your site.</p><h2>Tweaks</h2><p>If you want to modify this theme, I recommend that you first duplicate it,<br />
then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you'll still have the original files if you make a mess.<br />
More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on anomaly themes, it was<br />
originally designed for Moodle 1.9 by Patrick Malley. Archaius was created by Daniel Munera Sanchez.<br />
